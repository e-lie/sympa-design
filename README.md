# Sympa design resources

This repository contains the `.sketch` files of the new Sympa UI.

For now, all the screens are contained in one big Sketch.app file, but it the future it will be split up and better organised.

There will also be some asset export automation set up. We are just waiting on the Sketch.app 43 for their new file format, which should come soon.

For now, you can [preview those mockups here](https://s.sandhose.fr/sympa/).
